# GStreamer Implementation Plan for IPTV App

## Phase 1: Core GStreamer Integration

### 1.1 Dependencies Setup

- Add required dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:
  - `gstreamer` and related crates
  - `gstreamer-player` for high-level playback
  - `gstreamer-video` for video-specific features
  - Additional plugins based on streaming needs (RTSP, HLS, etc.)

### 1.2 Basic GStreamer Implementation

1. Create a new Rust module `src-tauri/src/video_player/`
2. Implement core player functionality:
   - Pipeline initialization
   - Basic playback controls (play, pause, seek)
   - Stream handling for different protocols
   - Error handling and recovery
3. Create event system for player state changes

## Phase 2: Tauri Integration Layer

### 2.1 Rust-Side Commands

1. Create command interface in Rust:
   - Initialize player
   - Control playback
   - Handle stream URLs
   - Manage quality settings
   - Stream information retrieval

### 2.2 Event System

1. Design event emission system:
   - Player state changes
   - Buffer status
   - Stream quality changes
   - Error conditions
2. Implement proper cleanup and resource management

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration

### 3.1 TypeScript/Svelte Layer

1. Create TypeScript interfaces for player commands
2. Implement state management store for player
3. Design event handlers for player updates
4. Create utility functions for common player operations

### 3.2 Custom UI Components

1. Design and implement core player controls:
   - Play/Pause button
   - Progress bar
   - Volume control
   - Quality selector
2. Create platform-specific UI variations:
   - Desktop interface
   - Mobile touch interface
   - Android TV remote-friendly interface

## Phase 4: Platform-Specific Optimizations

### 4.1 Android TV Support

1. Implement remote control navigation
2. Design TV-friendly UI components
3. Handle Android-specific media sessions
4. Optimize touch vs remote interactions

### 4.2 Desktop Optimizations

1. Implement keyboard shortcuts
2. Add context menu support
3. Handle window management events
4. Support multiple video windows

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### 5.1 Performance Optimizations

1. Implement efficient buffering strategies
2. Add hardware acceleration support
3. Optimize memory usage
4. Handle network conditions

### 5.2 Additional Features

1. Implement playlist support
2. Add subtitle handling
3. Support for multiple audio tracks
4. Picture-in-picture mode

## Implementation Order

1. Start with basic GStreamer setup and simple playback
2. Add core Tauri commands and events
3. Implement basic UI controls
4. Add platform-specific optimizations
5. Implement advanced features
6. Performance optimization and testing

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for Rust components
2. Integration tests for Tauri commands
3. UI component testing
4. End-to-end playback testing
5. Platform-specific testing
6. Performance benchmarking

## Notes

- Consider fallback options if GStreamer initialization fails
- Plan for proper error handling and user feedback
- Maintain flexibility for future codec support
- Focus on memory management and resource cleanup
- Consider DRM requirements if needed
